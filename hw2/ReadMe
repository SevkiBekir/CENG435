	To run this experiment, you need to use Pyton 2.7.6(The version of Inek Machines and GENIPortal have) and PySctp Library for SCTP
    To install pysctp on your computer, we prepared a shell script which is named as "setup.sh"
    To route data from client to server in routers, you need to route command. We prepared shell scripts which are named as "r1.sh" for Router 1 and "r2.sh" for Router 2 to run easily

    How to run codes:
    1) Run r1.sh in Router 1 and r2.sh in Router 2
    2) Run setup.sh
    3) Go to "pysctp/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/" since kernel module and lib are inside this folder.
    4) Copy our python files which are related to the mission. For example, for sctp server, it needs "server_sctp.py"
    5) Run our codes:

        For SCTP:
            server_sctp.py [experimentNo]
            client_sctp.py [input file] [experimentNo]
        Example:
            server_sctp.py 2
            client_sctp.py input.txt 2

        For Our RDT:
            server_rdt.py [experimentNo]
            client_rdt.py [input file] [experimentNo]
        Example:
            server_rdt.py 2
            client_rdt.py input.txt 2





	Note that before running the code, the address information of nodes have to be configured. According to topology which is provided by metu class.

    Generally, to calculate loss packages, corruption and reorder, all packets have to go from source to destination and calculate time, by using final time - starting time.
    To draw chart, we used LibreOfficeCalc and also all collected data in "data_chart.ods"
